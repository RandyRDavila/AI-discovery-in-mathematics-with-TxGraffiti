    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RandyRDavila/AI-discovery-in-mathematics-with-TxGraffiti/blob/main/notebooks/breast_cancer.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook applies the TxGraffiti algorithm to generate conjectures on the famous breast cancer dataset. The dataset is commonly used in machine learning for binary classification tasks and contains various features related to breast cancer tumors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of breast cancer tumor data and includes various numerical properties such as:\n",
    "- **Mean Radius**: The mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.\n",
    "- **Mean Texture**: The standard deviation of gray-scale values.\n",
    "- **Mean Perimeter**: The perimeter of the tumor.\n",
    "- **Mean Area**: The area of the tumor.\n",
    "- **Mean Smoothness**: The local variation in radius lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate conjectures relating different numerical properties of breast cancer tumors.\n",
    "- Identify significant relationships and patterns in tumor properties.\n",
    "- Apply the Theo and Static Dalmatian heuristics to filter and refine the conjectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the cells to load the dataset and apply TxGraffiti.**\n",
    "2. **Examine the generated conjectures and their significance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Discover new insights into breast cancer tumor properties with TxGraffiti.\n",
