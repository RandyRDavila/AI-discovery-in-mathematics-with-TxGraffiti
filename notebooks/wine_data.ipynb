    "# Wine Data Conjectures with TxGraffiti\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RandyRDavila/AI-discovery-in-mathematics-with-TxGraffiti/blob/main/notebooks/wine_data.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook applies the TxGraffiti algorithm to generate conjectures on the wine quality dataset. The wine quality dataset, commonly used in machine learning, includes various chemical properties of wines that can be used to predict their quality. By applying TxGraffiti, we aim to discover new relationships and patterns within this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of wine samples and includes various numerical properties such as:\n",
    "- **Numerical Properties**: Fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and quality.\n",
    "- **Boolean Properties**: High acidity, high sugar, high alcohol, high pH, and high quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate conjectures relating different numerical properties of wines.\n",
    "- Identify significant relationships and patterns in wine properties.\n",
    "- Apply the Theo and Static Dalmatian heuristics to filter and refine the conjectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the cells to load the dataset and apply TxGraffiti.**\n",
    "2. **Examine the generated conjectures and their significance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Discover new insights into wine properties and quality with TxGraffiti.\n",
