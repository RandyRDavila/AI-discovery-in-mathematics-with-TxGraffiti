    "# Scale-Free Graph Conjectures with TxGraffiti\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RandyRDavila/AI-discovery-in-mathematics-with-TxGraffiti/blob/main/notebooks/scale_free_graphs.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the application of the TxGraffiti algorithm to generate conjectures on scale-free graphs. Scale-free graphs are a type of graph characterized by the presence of hub nodes with a high degree of connectivity, and they are commonly found in natural and man-made systems, such as social networks and the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of randomly generated scale-free graphs and includes various numerical properties such as:\n",
    "- **Average Clustering Coefficient**: A measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.\n",
    "- **Degree Assortativity Coefficient**: A measure of the similarity of connections in the graph with respect to the node degree.\n",
    "- **Number of Triangles**: The number of triangles in the graph, indicating the presence of closely knit groups of nodes.\n",
    "- **Diameter**: The longest shortest path between any two nodes in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate conjectures relating different numerical properties of scale-free graphs.\n",
    "- Identify significant relationships and patterns in graph properties.\n",
    "- Apply the Theo and Static Dalmatian heuristics to filter and refine the conjectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the cells to generate the dataset and apply TxGraffiti.**\n",
    "2. **Examine the generated conjectures and their significance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore the unique properties of scale-free graphs and discover new insights with TxGraffiti.\n"
