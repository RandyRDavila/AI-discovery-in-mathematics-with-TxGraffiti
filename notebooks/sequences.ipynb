    "# Sequence Conjectures with TxGraffiti\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RandyRDavila/AI-discovery-in-mathematics-with-TxGraffiti/blob/main/notebooks/sequences.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook applies the TxGraffiti algorithm to generate conjectures on various sequences. Sequences are a fundamental concept in mathematics and appear in numerous fields, from number theory to computer science. Exploring relationships between different properties of sequences can lead to significant insights and new mathematical results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of various numerical sequences and includes properties such as:\n",
    "- **Numerical Properties**: Length, sum of elements, maximum value, minimum value, mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.\n",
    "- **Boolean Properties**: Arithmetic sequence, geometric sequence, Fibonacci sequence, prime sequence, and even sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate conjectures relating different numerical properties of sequences.\n",
    "- Identify significant relationships and patterns in sequence properties.\n",
    "- Apply the Theo and Static Dalmatian heuristics to filter and refine the conjectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the cells to generate the dataset and apply TxGraffiti.**\n",
    "2. **Examine the generated conjectures and their significance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore the fascinating world of sequences and discover new mathematical conjectures with TxGraffiti.\n",
